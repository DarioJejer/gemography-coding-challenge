# Gemography Front-end coding challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) given that it provides everything needed for a single-page (front-end only) app and it's an effortless way to set up the environment.

Albeit there was no need for Redux, given the simplicity of the app, it was added to showcase a more complex structure organization.

## To run the project

In the project directory, run:

### `npm start`


Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
